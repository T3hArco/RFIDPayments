This project features a simple PHP backend and HTML frontend. It has been written in my first academic year, without much knowledge of programming principles. The code works, and is used as a payment system for [EhackB](https://www.ehackb.be). It is capable to running 48 hours without any problems. 

### Features:
  - Balance recharging
  - Product sales
  - User registration, using external database (format for Laravel)

*Missing features*:
  - The application does not really use OOP, it should be refactored to do so
  - Misses some front-ends for statistics.
